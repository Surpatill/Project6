Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast daily sales in Rossmann stores. The analysis focuses on identifying key factors that affect sales, including customer purchasing behavior, store type, and seasonal fluctuations.

Objectives
1. Develop a predictive model to forecast daily sales in Rossmann stores.
2. Analyze customer purchasing behavior and identify key factors that affect sales.
3. Compare the performance of machine learning and deep learning models.
4. Deploy the best-performing model as a web application.

Key Findings
1. Sales peaks at specific values ($4,000, $6,000, and $8,000).
2. High frequency of transactions at $6,000.
3. Positive correlation between customer numbers and sales.
4. Variations in average sales across days of the week and months.
5. Store type and seasonal fluctuations significantly impact sales.

Methodology
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors affecting sales.
3. Development and comparison of machine learning and deep learning models.
4. Deployment of the best-performing model as a web application.

Technologies Used
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
5. Scikit-learn
6. TensorFlow
7. Flask

Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights for Rossmann stores, highlighting the importance of considering customer purchasing behavior, store type, and seasonal fluctuations when making strategic decisions. The predictive model developed in this project can be used to forecast daily sales and inform inventory management and staffing decisions.
